 *  As an example of the number of different zmanim made available

 *  The methods for doing zmanim calculations not present in this class or its
 *  superclass the KCZmanimCalendar are contained in KCAstronomicalCalendar,
 *  the base class of the calendars in our API since they are generic methods
 *  for calculating time based on degrees or time before or after sunrise and 
 *  sunset and
 *  are of interest for calculation beyond zmanim calculations.
