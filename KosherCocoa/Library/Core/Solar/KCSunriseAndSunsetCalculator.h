 *	and the Earth were without an atmosphere, true sunset and sunrise would
 *	correspond to a 90&deg; zenith. Because the Sun is not a point, and
 *	because the atmosphere refracts light, this 90&deg; zenith does not, in
 *	fact, correspond to true sunset or sunrise, instead the centre of the
 *	Sun's disk must lie just below the horizon for the upper edge to be
 *	obscured. This means that a zenith of just above 90&deg; must be used.
 *	The Sun subtends an angle of 16 minutes of arc (this can be changed via
 *	the {@link #setSolarRadius(double)} method , and atmospheric refraction
 *	accounts for 34 minutes or so, giving a total of 50 arcminutes.
 *	The total value for ZENITH is 90+(5/6) or 90.8333333&deg; for true
